## Before You Begin
This lab assumes you have launched a Redshift cluster.  If you have not launched a cluster, see [LAB 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters](../lab1/README.md).  

## Event Subscriptions
Navigate to your Redshift Events page.  Notice the events involved with creating the cluster.  Click on the subscriptions tab.

## Cluster Encryption
## Cross Region Replication

## Before You Leave
If you are done using your cluster, please think about decommissioning it to avoid having to pay for unused resources.
